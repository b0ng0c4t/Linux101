# I use this in RHEL, CentOS and Fedora.

#-FILE SYSTEM HIERARCHY-#
/etc #Contains configuration files for programs and packages
/var #Variable data specific to system. This data should not be removed or changed when the system reboots. Logs files tend to be stored within the /var directory
/run #Runtime data for processes since last boot
/home #Location of home directories; used for storing personal documents and information on the system
/root #root user home directory
/tmp #Files are removed after ten days; universal read/write permissions
/boot #files needed to start the system boot process
/dev #Contains information on essential devices
